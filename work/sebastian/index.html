        <h2>Provocation</h2>
        <p>
          “Indeed, it [the cell phone] has taken over much of what used to be
          defined as the responsibility of shelter in terms of sense of
          security, space, orientation, and representation.” [1] Both at home
          and in public, we are often absorbed by our devices, dissociated from
          physical reality and algorithmically siloed off to our assigned echo
          chambers. How can we feel safer and more comfortable in the world, so
          as to not require constant shielding and distraction from it? How can
          we consume digital content together and avoid polarization? What role
          can the built environment play in the pursuit of these goals?

        <h2>The Project</h2>

        <p>The technology to display information at a variety of sites is readily available: projectors, TVs, monitors, speakers… but pairing them to a person’s unique digital world can be a cumbersome process. The challenge here is securely providing these displays and interfaces access to a person’s information in a fully consensual way.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>I propose the development of a system for such device pairing and information sharing. It will be employed by a mobile application that allows users to create a profile, as they would at a social media platform, and selectively expose data to authorized peripherals. These peripherals will broadcast BLE beacon signals, alerting the application of their proximity and their capabilities, at which point the application can broker data exchange over cloud infrastructure. The peripherals are now able to activate context-aware experiences based on the people present.</p>

        <br></br>
        <p>On the other hand, these technologies are routinely exploited to surveil consumers. Most people are unaware of this phenomenon, due to a lack of transparency in privacy policies and the prevalence of advertising software that finds its way into popular app SDKs. Much like cookies track people through the web, BLE beacons can be used to uniquely and precisely track people's location indoors (where GPS usually fails). My proposal is to develop a process for identifying such beacons and which apps they are communicating with. Then I will conduct a survey of retail locations throughout Manhattan to build a dataset of spatial data collection practices.</p>

        <br></br>
        <p>The project will be presented as an interactive experience, where people will have previously downloaded the app and created a profile. The space will curate and display media experiences based on those present and the data they have shared. Data visualizations about my research in unethical use of this technology will be displayed throughout the room in juxtaposition. In this way, people will experience a frictionless, context-aware and embodied social media interaction, while learning about the dangers of these technologies and how to guard themselves against its misuse.</p>

                <p>The entire space will be designed to afford collaborative interactions, rather than individual consumption of media on a phone. A combination of screens with classic UIs, as well as sensors and projectors will come together to enable gestural interaction with the system.</p>

On resonators where interaction is possible, the rules of the system and its feedback mechanisms will define the resulting experience.</p>

            <h2>Design Methods</h2>
            <p>I am inspired by research on spatial, tangible, and collaborative interfaces, and wish to push this inquiry further by applying ideas and practices developed for communal living to a newly imagined communal digital space. In communal living, people have varying preferences of where their boundary of privacy lies, such as being comfortable sharing a kitchen, but not a bathroom. This work is speculative and participatory in nature, as it aims to expand the boundary of digital privacy people are comfortable with through a co-lived experience. The effects of such an experience might be restorative and lead to strengthened social connection [2] and pave the way for people to more deeply engage with each other in public.</p>

          <p>The project is aimed for the General public, but people will differ in their willingness to engage with others in public space. People have varying levels of comfort sharing media online as well. Designing the UX of the application, as well as the experiences themselves, will be a crucial point to iterate and perfect so that no personality types or groups are left out of the experience. Because the system is novel and has few precedents, it will be important to adapt as the system is tested, since predicting all possible outcomes would be impossible.</p>
