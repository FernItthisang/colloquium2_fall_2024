                <h3>Locating trust and novel forms of sharing.</h3>
                <p>
                    Unique combinations of sensors, hardware, and synthetic rulesets govern our Western world. We believe
                    by developing novel mobile hardware that scaffolds localized trust by reducing interactional affordances
                    and introducing physical-digital sharing protocols, we can support a more relationally connected future.

                        We are developing a novel navigation and social networking experience that fosters trusted
                        real-world interactions through generating contextual itineraries from aggregating your
                        peers’ location-recommendations with your personal context and location intelligence to
                        reduce screen dependency and build relational trust and intersubjectivity within communities
                        through shared experiences.

                    <h3>Computational Methods</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stephen Levinson’s work on the Human Interaction Engine attributes three properties of Human
                        social interaction: The attribution of intention through behavior mapping onto goals, mutual
                        salience or common ground—necessary for cooperative interaction, and intentions that drive
                        behavior solely effected by virtue. Because technology and tools become an extension of our
                        cognition, it is important to explore and create new configurations of sensors and rulesets
                        to afford a different texture of presence that preserves the elements of our human
                        sociality. This is a socially oriented practice, which aims to create new social structures
                        and scaffolding for more authentic relations than incumbent digital systems do.

                    <p>
                        There have been a number of precedents, either full reduced affordance provocations or companion
                        device consumer hardware for different use-cases. Take SUSA for ASUS for example, a device that aims
                        to suggest how AI could be used to shift how we interact with certain digital devices to create a
                        more intuitive, tactile, and less distracting experience. Our project provides a tangible
                        intermediate step to approaching the idea of new mobile computation methods through positioning a
                        commercially viable use-case for reducing our time spent on devices in a social and navigational
                        context.

                        How do you create an ecosystem where meaning is built on inherent relational trust in existing
                        relations? By prioritizing near-field sharing protocols verified through geo-specific protocols.
                        This way, what is lost on screen might be added in-person.

                        Current online network communities take many different approaches at organizing their communities.
                        We propose teasing out and visualizing a user's network by exposing their timezone (awake, sleeping),
                        updates on where they’ve been place-wise recently, and visualizing who’s connected to who.

                        auxiliary distractions of other notifications.

                        about the place. This final step elevates the experience through intersubjectivity.

                According to the Carson College of Business’ 2024 American Travel Survey, over a third of Gen Z (38%) and
                Millennials (34%) expect to spend “a lot of time” comparing costs of travel destinations and activities.
                These generations rely heavily on technology for planning and prioritize authenticity and sustainability.
